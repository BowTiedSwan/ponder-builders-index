Awesome brief. I dug through Ponder’s docs and recent updates and put together a concrete architecture + migration path that ticks your boxes: multiple contracts (incl. factories), reuse of existing subgraphs (by subgraph ID), and serving both GraphQL and SQL over HTTPS for front-ends.

TL;DR recommendation

Stand up one Ponder app per domain (or product surface) backed by Postgres, index all relevant contracts (including child contracts created by factories) using Ponder’s factory pattern, and expose:
	•	GraphQL via Ponder’s built-in middleware for app/UX queries, and
	•	SQL over HTTP via @ponder/client for power queries and dashboards.
While re-implementing mappings in Ponder, federate your existing The Graph subgraphs behind an Apollo Gateway so front-ends get one stable endpoint during migration. Use Ponder’s views schema for blue/green deployments.

Why Ponder fits here (features you’ll use)
	•	GraphQL out-of-the-box via middleware (with GraphiQL) from your generated schema.  ￼ ￼
	•	SQL over HTTP (@ponder/client) as a first-class query path—great for analytics/UI tables without building custom endpoints.  ￼
	•	Direct SQL against Postgres when needed (server-side jobs, BI).  ￼
	•	Factory pattern to index dynamically created child contracts (your “factory contracts” use-case).  ￼
	•	CLI + code-first DX to spin up projects (create-ponder).  ￼
	•	Views schema flag for stable schemas and zero-downtime cutovers in managed environments.  ￼

Proposed architecture

1) Indexing layer (Ponder)
	•	Project layout
	•	Monorepo with packages like apps/ponder-markets, apps/ponder-payments, etc., or one app if your domain is small.
	•	Each app defines contracts in ponder.config.ts (addresses, ABIs, chains).
	•	Factories → children
	•	Register handlers for the factory’s “create/deploy” event and add the new child address to Ponder using the documented factory pattern. Also register an indexing function for the factory itself to run any per-child setup.  ￼
	•	DB
	•	Postgres (managed OK). Ponder writes strongly typed tables from your schema; you can query with GraphQL, SQL over HTTP, or direct SQL.  ￼
	•	Use a separate schema per deployment and enable --views-schema so the “public” schema points to the latest ready views after historical sync—clean blue/green.  ￼

2) Query layer (HTTPS)
	•	GraphQL: mount Ponder’s GraphQL middleware; you get GraphiQL in dev and a generated schema.graphql during build. Ideal for front-end product queries.  ￼
	•	SQL over HTTP: expose @ponder/client to let front-ends (or your server) run parameterized SQL via HTTPS—great for complex filters/sorts/joins without resolvers.  ￼
	•	Direct SQL (optional): for internal jobs/BI, hit Postgres read-only replicas.  ￼

3) Federation with existing Subgraphs (keep your subgraph IDs)
	•	Put an Apollo Gateway/Router in front of:
	•	Ponder app(s) GraphQL endpoint(s), and
	•	Existing The Graph subgraphs using their network endpoint by subgraph ID, e.g.
https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_ID>.  ￼ ￼
	•	Compose into a single supergraph. Later, as you migrate features from the legacy subgraphs into Ponder, just update the composition.  ￼ ￼

Migration plan (from current subgraphs to Ponder)

Phase 0 – Inventory (1–2 days)
	•	List contracts, networks, ABIs, factory relationships.
	•	List existing subgraphs + subgraph IDs and the entity fields they serve today.

Phase 1 – Bootstrap (1–3 days)
	•	pnpm create ponder to scaffold. Wire RPCs, Postgres, and the GraphQL/SQL endpoints.  ￼
	•	Define initial schema/entities to mirror the subgraphs’ most-used entities.

Phase 2 – Implement factories & events (3–7 days)
	•	Add factory handlers to capture deployed child contracts and register them for indexing; index core events + function calls as needed.  ￼
	•	Implement indexing functions via ponder.on("Contract:Event", ...).  ￼

Phase 3 – Stand up query surface (1–2 days)
	•	Enable GraphQL and SQL over HTTP endpoints in the app.  ￼
	•	Start with Ponder-sourced fields that match the most queried subgraph entities.

Phase 4 – Federate (1–3 days)
	•	Deploy Apollo Gateway/Router that composes:
	•	SubgraphA/SubgraphB via their ID endpoints, and
	•	ponder-<domain> as another subgraph.  ￼ ￼
	•	Front-ends now query one GraphQL endpoint while you migrate piecemeal.

Phase 5 – Parity + cutover (ongoing)
	•	For each entity/resolver from The Graph, re-implement in Ponder and update the federation to favor Ponder’s type/fields. Use schema checks to avoid regressions.  ￼
	•	When a subgraph is fully mirrored, remove it from the gateway.

Phase 6 – Hardening
	•	Turn on --views-schema for safe rollouts; add read replicas and caching (e.g., CDN on SQL over HTTP if responses are cacheable).  ￼

Practical notes & trade-offs
	•	Where to put the line between GraphQL vs SQL-HTTP?
	•	Use GraphQL for product features and typed contracts with the UI.
	•	Use SQL-HTTP for power users (grids, explorers, reporting) and for queries that are awkward to express in GraphQL.  ￼
	•	Dynamic contract sprawl
	•	The factory pattern scales cleanly and avoids “regen/redeploy” overhead seen in legacy setups with dynamic data sources.  ￼
	•	Blue/green & historical sync
	•	With the views schema, you can sync history on a new deployment, then atomically flip views to it once ready. This keeps your prod schema stable for clients.  ￼
	•	DX & speed
	•	Ponder’s dev server + code-first mapping is fast and familiar to TS teams; initial benchmarks claim big speedups vs. subgraphs, but validate with your own data.  ￼

Step-by-step “getting started” (first app)
	1.	Scaffold

pnpm create ponder
# configure chains, RPCs, Postgres URL

￼
	2.	Model & handlers

	•	Define your entities; implement ponder.on("Contract:Event") and any call-based indexing you need.  ￼

	3.	Factories

	•	Register the factory contract; on its “Created/Deployed” event, add the child contract using the doc’s factory pattern.  ￼

	4.	Serve

	•	Enable GraphQL middleware for /graphql.  ￼
	•	Add SQL over HTTP with @ponder/client for /sql.  ￼

	5.	Deploy with views

pnpm start --schema $DEPLOYMENT_ID --views-schema app_public

￼
	6.	Gateway

	•	Stand up Apollo Gateway that composes your Ponder endpoint + any The Graph subgraphs referenced by subgraph ID URLs.  ￼ ￼

What I’d ship first (prioritized)
	1.	One Ponder app indexing your highest-traffic domain + its factories.
	2.	Apollo Gateway composing that app with the current subgraphs (by ID).  ￼ ￼
	3.	Expose GraphQL + SQL-HTTP to front-ends; migrate the top 5 queries from The Graph to Ponder.  ￼
	4.	Flip those features to Ponder in the gateway; iterate.


Got it. Here’s a concrete, docs-grounded plan to build your indexers with Ponder, cover factories + many contracts, and serve GraphQL and SQL over HTTPS—while federating in any existing subgraphs (by subgraph ID) so front-ends keep one stable API during the migration.

Architecture (high level)
	1.	One Ponder app per domain (or one app if simple), backed by Postgres.
	•	Define contracts/ABIs/chains in ponder.config.ts. Write indexing functions for events/txs/blocks.  ￼
	2.	Factories → children: use Ponder’s factory pattern to discover and start indexing newly created child contracts at runtime. Also register an indexing function on the factory itself for per-child setup.  ￼
	3.	Query surfaces over HTTPS:
	•	GraphQL (auto-generated) for product/UI queries. Comes with GraphiQL in dev and a generated schema.graphql.  ￼
	•	SQL over HTTP via @ponder/client for power queries, grids, dashboards—an official, typed alternative to GraphQL.  ￼ ￼
	•	(Optional) Direct SQL to Postgres for internal jobs/BI; Ponder documents how to target schemas safely.  ￼
	4.	Blue/green & zero-downtime: enable the views pattern (Ponder flag --views-schema) so a stable “public” schema points to the newest ready deployment after historical sync.  ￼
	5.	Federation layer in front of everything: an Apollo Gateway/Router that composes:
	•	Your Ponder GraphQL endpoint(s), plus
	•	Any existing The Graph subgraphs using the network endpoint by subgraph ID
https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_ID>.  ￼
Apollo Federation handles schema composition; you can shift ownership of types from legacy subgraphs to Ponder incrementally.  ￼

Implementation path (practical & sequenced)

Phase 0 — Inventory (contracts & subgraphs)
	•	List contracts, networks, ABIs, and all factory → child relations.
	•	List active subgraphs + subgraph IDs you want to keep serving during the cutover. (You’ll plug these IDs directly into the gateway.)  ￼

Phase 1 — Bootstrap Ponder
	•	Scaffold with create-ponder; wire RPCs and Postgres.  ￼
	•	Model your tables in ponder.schema.ts; Ponder auto-generates GraphQL from this schema.  ￼
	•	Write minimal indexing functions (e.g., core events) to populate those tables.  ￼

Phase 2 — Handle factories (dynamic contracts)
	•	Implement the factory pattern: listen to the factory’s “Created/Deployed” event and register each new child contract so Ponder indexes it going forward. Also index the factory itself for per-child setup.  ￼
	•	Recent Ponder releases improved performance for large factory sets (10k+ addresses), so scaling here is explicitly supported.  ￼

Phase 3 — Stand up query endpoints
	•	Expose GraphQL (auto-generated, GraphiQL in dev) at /graphql.  ￼
	•	Expose SQL over HTTP using @ponder/client at e.g. /sql (or from your frontend/server). Use it for complex filters/joins that don’t map cleanly to GraphQL.  ￼
	•	Keep Direct SQL for internal analytics; follow Ponder’s guidance on targeting the right schema.  ￼

Phase 4 — Add the federation layer (one endpoint for front-ends)
	•	Configure Apollo Gateway/Router and compose:
	•	ponder-core (and any other Ponder apps), and
	•	legacy subgraphs via the subgraph ID network URL.  ￼ ￼
	•	Front-ends now query one GraphQL endpoint while you migrate resolvers/types to Ponder behind the scenes.  ￼

Phase 5 — Blue/green deploys & cutovers
	•	Start Ponder with --views-schema your_public_schema so each fresh deployment backfills in isolation and then atomically flips the views when ready—no client/schema churn.  ￼
	•	Migrate top queries first: reproduce the fields/types those subgraphs serve in your Ponder schema, then update federation to make Ponder the source of truth for those types.  ￼ ￼
	•	Use Ponder’s status endpoints to confirm block sync before switching traffic.  ￼

How to split GraphQL vs SQL over HTTP
	•	GraphQL: primary UX/API surface—typed, stable, cacheable, great for mobile/web data needs. Auto-generated from your ponder.schema.ts.  ￼
	•	SQL over HTTP (@ponder/client): power features—explorers, admin grids, ad-hoc analytics, or places needing arbitrarily composable filters and joins without new resolvers. It’s an official Ponder query path.  ￼
	•	Direct SQL: internal jobs/BI; follow Ponder’s schema-targeting guidance (or use the views schema).  ￼

⸻

Ops / production notes
	•	Postgres schemas per deployment + views schema = clean rollouts & instant rollback.  ￼
	•	Ponder’s HTTP server is Hono-based, so adding custom routes (health, custom endpoints) is straightforward.  ￼
	•	Keep an eye on indexing status via /status or _meta in GraphQL for observability.  ￼
	•	Ponder’s benchmarks claim notable speed vs. classic subgraphs—validate with your own data, but performance focus is explicit.  ￼

Day-1 checklist
	1.	pnpm create ponder → configure chains, Postgres.  ￼
	2.	Define tables in ponder.schema.ts; write first indexing functions.  ￼ ￼
	3.	Implement factory pattern for dynamic children.  ￼
	4.	Expose /graphql and SQL over HTTP via @ponder/client.  ￼
	5.	Run with --views-schema in staging; verify backfill, then flip.  ￼
	6.	Stand up Apollo Gateway, compose Ponder + legacy subgraph-ID endpoints under one URL.  ￼ ￼

If you share your contract list and the subgraph IDs you’re relying on, I can sketch the first ponder.config.ts (incl. factory listeners), propose the initial ponder.schema.ts, and a federation map showing which types live in Ponder vs. legacy on week 1 vs. week 4.
